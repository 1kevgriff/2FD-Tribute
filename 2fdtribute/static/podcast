<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Why You Should DIY Your Debt Relief</h2>



<p>DIY debt relief is nothing new. The Snowball Method and Avalanche Method are two commonly discussed tactics for paying down your debt. </p>



<p>The Snowball Method encourages you to pay off your smaller debts first to build sustainable habits. Once those debts are paid off, you use the money to tackle the bigger debts. </p>



<p>The Avalanche Method takes the opposite approach. It encourages you to pay down the debts with the highest interest first, with the potential to get you out of debt sooner and save you money. However, this can be more challenging from a sustainable habit-building perspective. The Snowball Method is a great starting point, but you should plan on shifting to the avalanche after you find your motivation.</p>



<p>Regardless of which option you choose, taking the DIY approach makes sense. It helps you save fees (or more debt) by hiring a service or coach. It also starts to build those habits and mindset shifts within you for long-term success.</p>



<h2>How to Do the DIY Debt Landslide</h2>



<p>The Debt Landslide is ideal for anyone who has a major purchase in the near future. The idea is focusing on your debt <em>newest</em> account because the various credit score bureaus weigh your most recent activity over your debt history. By paying down your newest account, you&#8217;ll build your credit score faster.</p>



<p>In other words, if you know you&#8217;re going to need a loan for a new car next year, start paying down the most recent debt now.</p>



<h2>How to Do the DIY Debt Cascade</h2>



<p>The other DIY debt payment methods are for those who have a bit of extra money to put toward their debt. The Debt Cascade is for those who are living from paycheck to paycheck. </p>



<p>With the Debt Cascade, you&#8217;ll make your minimum payments this month as your baseline. Then, you&#8217;ll pay the same amount again next month, even if they say the minimum amount has gone down. Continue this process until you are able to create that gap between what they&#8217;re asking and what you have.</p>



<p>For example, if your minimum payment is $50 per month when you get started, it could be $45 next month. Instead of paying $45, pay $50 again and chip away at that debt over time.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>What is Tiller Money?</h2>



<p>Tiller Money is a budgeting app that syncs with your bank accounts and pulls the categorized data to Google Sheets. This easy synchronization makes it easier to manipulate the data and generate the info you want to see at any given time.</p>



<h2>Why Use the Tiller Money App?</h2>



<p>One of the great features is that you can set up different budgets for different months, which is different than other budgeting apps that take a more static approach. Tiller is also ideal for people who like something more tangible rather than operating within an app.</p>



<p>The Tiller Money App also sends a daily email giving you a financial snapshot of what&#8217;s going on in your accounts. They also have a community with training webinars and a beta lab for extensions to your core spreadsheet.</p>



<h2>Is Tiller Worth It?</h2>



<p>Tiller is well worth the investment if you&#8217;re looking to dive into your budget and want to manipulate the data and analyze it to your liking.</p>



<p>The annual fee is around $50, but you can get a 30 Day Free Trial <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/pricing/">here.</a></p>

<h2>Working on Your Business vs. Working in Your Business</h2>



<p>What&#8217;s the difference between working <em>on</em> your business and working <em>in</em> your business?</p>



<p>Every business starts with a vision. It&#8217;s an idea about an opportunity that begins to take form. </p>



<p>Then comes the detailed planning. Things like procuring office supplies and putting a financial plan in place. In essence, you become a manager.</p>



<p>Then comes the technical side of your work: the skills and execution.</p>



<p>For many entrepreneurs, the technical side becomes a comfort zone. It becomes challenging to delegate without stifling their creativity or micromanaging. </p>



<p>When you work on the business, you set standard operating procedures, job descriptions, and high-level tasks that make delegation possible. It means looking ahead and reverse engineering your goals to get outside the one-person show and grow. You execute, analyze, and adjust.</p>



<h2>Maximizing Your Business During the Pandemic</h2>



<p>The pandemic has caused a lot of challenges for many businesses. However, there are also vast opportunities that can take your business to the next level. From acquiring new assets at a low rate to providing solutions to help customers recover, there&#8217;s always an opportunity to succeed. </p>



<p>Look at your competition and see who is going out of business and selling their supplies. Look at your customers and see how you can be proactive during these changing times.</p>



<p>Be the person that steps up and fix something that&#8217;s wrong. Consumers are looking for innovators and leaders in this situation. Be proactive, mobilize, and capitalize.</p>



<h2>How to Push Ahead as an Entrepreneur</h2>



<p>Take an objective approach to everything you see and hear as an entrepreneur. Find ways to evolve and adapt to changing times. </p>



<p>To do this, you&#8217;ll need to take a step back and look at your business as a whole. Find the workaround and find wiggle room within protocols to change your offerings and adapt to the market. </p>



<p>Creativity and discipline will be your two greatest assets as an entrepreneur, regardless of what situation you find yourself in.</p>



<h2>Four Keys to Success when Working on Your Business</h2>



<ol><li>You have to be committed. Burn the boats and don&#8217;t look back. </li><li>Be totally determined in everything you do. If there&#8217;s something you want, you need to take the approach that nothing can stop you from getting across the finish line.</li><li>Put disciplines in your life that allow your dreams to come true. Procrastinate on the things that don&#8217;t lead to your goals.</li><li>Visualize your success. Visualization is a powerful mental tool. Think about what your business will look like in the future, then visualize the path to get there.</li></ol>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Episode 185: How can you give back while saving money? We&#8217;re talking about the joys of giving while pursuing financial independence, and a few ways to be a giver.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>One of the most significant mindset shifts when pursuing financial independence is learning the value of giving. When you start to realize that you can live on less, you find that you&#8217;re able to give more to the causes that matter to you.</p>



<h2>Find Your Cause</h2>



<p>Think of the causes that matter to you. It could be anything from your local church to a non-profit that supports something that impacts your life. Giving to a cause that aligns with your values is guaranteed to make you feel good.</p>



<h2>Set Aside Money to Give </h2>



<p>Both Kevin and Sean work giving into their budget. Consider using separate accounts or working automation into your banking to ensure the cause you care about is cared for before you spend. </p>



<h2>Pay it Forward</h2>



<p>One of the best ways to be a giver is to pay it forward. Consider surprising someone by paying for their order in the drive through or giving an extra generous tip to a minimum wage worker. These small actions ultimately mean nothing when calculating how much money ends up in your bank account. Yet it can make a big impact on someone&#8217;s day.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>The Ideal Real Estate Deal</h2>



<p>Many people ask what the ideal real estate deal looks like. The ideal real estate deal is a multi-family purchase that becomes an income-generating property within 12 months using $0 out-of-pocket.</p>



<p>How does this happen?</p>



<p>BRRRR</p>



<h2>What is BRRRR?</h2>



<p>BRRRR is an acronym that stands for:</p>



<ul><li>Buy</li><li>Rehab</li><li>Rent</li><li>Refinance</li><li>Repeat</li></ul>



<p>Buy a distressed asset, rehab it, rent out the units to give yourself some money, refinance, and repeat with a new property.</p>



<p>Over time, as you build your reputation, you&#8217;ll be able to secure $0 out-of-pocket deals. Real estate investing is also a team sport: if you find the deal, the capital will come.</p>



<h2>How to Be a Successful Landlord</h2>



<p>The trick to becoming a successful landlord is accountability. Protecting your investment by holding tenants accountable to their actions, even when it means making difficult decisions. Sometimes that means being the bad guy in an eviction situation.</p>



<p>It also means being an advocate for your tenants and helping them figure something out during a tough situation, like the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p>Finally, continuously updating and adapting your contracts will ensure that you&#8217;re covered no matter what happens. Using the Bigger Pockets pro membership can help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Episode 183: On this episode of the Where Our Money Went series, we&#8217;re talking mortgage insurance, Amazon Prime, and streaming services. Tune in for tips on choosing a mortgage insurance provider for your home.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>What is Mortgage Insurance?</h2>



<p>Mortgage insurance is required in many areas. The purpose is to cover the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage. If you have a USDA or FHA mortgage, you&#8217;ll be required to pay mortgage insurance up until a certain portion of your premium is paid off. For private mortgage insurance providers, mortgage insurance is often required if you have a down payment of less than 20% of the total home cost.</p>



<p>A few months ago, Kevin eliminated his mortgage insurance (PMI) because he had built up enough equity by paying down the premium. Kevin discovered that he had an overage and received a refund from the mortgage company. He used the money to make an extra mortgage payment on the principle. </p>



<h2>How Mortgage Insurance is Calculated</h2>



<p>Your mortgage insurance will depend on a lot of variables. You have the opportunity to shop around and compare companies, but it&#8217;s not a direct comparison. There are different accreditation to consider, the depth of the coverage, environmental and geographical considerations, etc. </p>



<p>Take time to read the fine print and highlight any red flags or perceived benefits before making a decision on your provider.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Episode 182: Learn how to teach financial literacy to children and why kids are never too young to learn about personal finance. We&#8217;re talking about the free K-12 Financial Education curriculum and how it&#8217;s impacting students of all ages. </em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Why Teach Kids About Personal Finance</h2>



<p>Healthy financial habits start at a young age. Children are influenced by their parents when it comes to money management. Teaching kids about personal finance before they&#8217;re out on their own, you can set them up for future success and help them set their own path forward.</p>



<p>Young children in elementary school can learn the basics, with the lessons getting more complex as they get older. As a younger child, learning that money is earned, how to save up for something, and the importance of giving are age-appropriate lessons. At the high school level, that evolves into the specific skills, understanding credit, learning how to invest, etc.</p>



<p>The Choose FI Foundation is a completely free curriculum that has lessons covering from kindergarten to graduation. Whether you&#8217;re a teacher, homeschooler, or an interested parent, you can access that information <a href="https://www.choosefifoundation.org/k12-education/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Why Teach Kids Entrepreneurship</h2>



<p>A lot of courses will teach people about how to cut your budget and expenses to save more money. However, that&#8217;s only one side of the equation. Building your wealth through side hustles, improved job opportunities, and negotiating payments can increase income on a grander scale.</p>



<p>It also helps students develop the skills they&#8217;ll need outside of school to survive and thrive as adults. From planning to problem-solving to interacting with other people, there are non-monetary benefits to learning the basics of entrepreneurship.</p>

<h2>A PPP Update</h2>



<p>Kevin finally received his PPP update. The program had come to a halt as funding dried up, but some of the larger businesses have paid back their funds, creating opportunities for small businesses across the country. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re an employee for a small business, talk to your employer about the PPP. There have been reports of employers who have received the PPP but haven&#8217;t paid their employees, which is what the program is for. These situations can be reported.</p>



<h2>Thank a Teacher</h2>



<p>Remember to set aside some money in your budget to buy a gift for your children&#8217;s teachers in this strange year. This experience has been a great reminder of how essential and valued teachers truly are.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Tips for Allocating Your Salary</h2>



<p>The first step in allocating your salary is to shift your mindset. Train yourself to forget about a percentage of the money you earn, using automation to allocate it toward a high-interest savings account before it hits your account. Thanks to compound interest, every little bit counts and your retirement will be covered.</p>



<h2>How to Find Comfort, Peace, and Freedom at any Level</h2>



<p>To achieve comfort, peace, and freedom at any income level is to identify what you want your life to look like. What&#8217;s your why? What&#8217;s the thing that drives you and keeps you moving forward?</p>



<p>If you can start visualizing what you want your life to look like (even going as far as to create a vision board) you can identify what will bring you comfort, peace, and freedom. Drill down into the minutia and start to make a plan.</p>



<p>Begin with the end in mind.</p>



<h2>Five Steps for Achieving Any Goal</h2>



<p></p>



<h3>Take a Second to Congratulate Yourself</h3>



<p>The first step is acknowledging the decision you&#8217;ve made. Congratulating yourself can help trigger a mindset shift. Picture yourself as a winner and pursue that image.</p>



<h3>Make Your Goal Crystal Clear</h3>



<p>Make your goal as clear as possible. Get into the finer details and cover all your bases. Be proactive in considering potential barriers. </p>



<h3>Build the Goal with Certainty</h3>



<p>Break your goal into pieces. If your timeline is a year, break it into traceable goals for the months, weeks, and days ahead. Breaking it into small, actionable steps makes it easier to move forward.</p>



<h3>Make Your Goal Automatic</h3>



<p>Use automation to reach your goal. For financial goals, you can go to your payroll officer and have them put money aside off each paycheck. You can set an automatic transfer to move money to an account you can reach on the day you get paid.</p>



<p>Remove your human nature from the equation, and embrace the idea of setting it and not sweating it.</p>



<h3>Share Your Goal</h3>



<p>Now it&#8217;s time to tell people about your goal. This will create accountability. Build a support team that will remind you of your goals and what you&#8217;re working toward.</p>
